## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I used proposed by Lucas VS Code plugin `px to rem` to make whole view more
responsible. This project was easier than previous, so basically I managed to do it
on my own without googling anything - this small project ensured me that I have
understood basics from previous one.

In this particular project I'm not sure if there's a difference between desktop and mobile design. However I managed to play a bit with scalling (not included in solution).

### Continued development

Deeper understanding of CSS positioning, which still confuses me sometimes.

Thanks for Lucas for giving me quick feedback after my first upload. It pointed me
new things to think about during coding and motivated to move on.
